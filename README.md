# MediScribe
Over 300 million patient consultations occur in the NHS annually. After each consultation, the general practitioner (GP) must manually log the consultation details into an Electronic Health Record (EHR), which can take 10-15 minutes. Annually, that is over 75,000,000 NHS hours. Currently, NHS staff face time pressure due to underfunding of the NHS and short staffing. MediScribe thus aims to reduce the time spent amongst practitioners logging consultation data. It is a part-solution to the NHS’ Long Term Plan for “digitally enabled care” to go “mainstream across the NHS” by 2029. In MediScribe, patient consultations will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Pertinent details from the transcription will then be automatically logged into the EHR. The recording will then be deleted 16 hours after the transcription is complete. Patients worried about privacy can opt out of the program. Data from MediScribe will be compliant with FHIR.  Overall, MediScribe can reduce the administrative burden on GPs, freeing up NHS hours.
