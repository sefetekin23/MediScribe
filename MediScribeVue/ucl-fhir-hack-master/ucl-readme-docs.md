Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) revolutionizes data exchange in healthcare, enhancing interoperability across systems. Developed by HL7, FHIR employs web technologies for seamless communication in hospitals like GOSH, aggregating data for unified patient records. It promotes interoperability among EHR systems, streamlining data access, improving care coordination, and enabling patient engagement. The UCL FHIRWorks 2024 emphasizes leveraging FHIR for innovative healthcare solutions, providing students with a platform to apply programming skills for enhanced patient care and healthcare informatics transformation.

## üî• Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started building and coding SMART-on-FHIR applications, you'll need a combination of foundational knowledge, tools, and resources. Here are the basic things required to begin coding SMART-on-FHIR applications.

### Prerequisites

1. Understanding of FHIR Standards:
Familiarize yourself with the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard using the [FHIR Documentation](https://fhir-ru.github.io/documentation.html). However, a good knowledge of [FHIR resources RESTful APIs, searching and the principles](https://fhir-ru.github.io/search.html) of data exchange in healthcare is important.

2. Knowledge of OAuth 2.0:
[SMART-on-FHIR](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/) uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. Gain a solid understanding of OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization in healthcare applications.

3. Development Environment:
Set up a development environment with a suitable programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java) and a web development framework.

4. FHIR Server:
Choose or set up a FHIR server to interact with FHIR resources. You can use public servers like [HAPI FHIR](http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4), or [set up your own](https://github.com/gosh-dre/ucl-fhir-hack/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). In our case, we are going to use [Azure API for FHIR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/) provided by GOSH.

5. SMART-on-FHIR Client Library:
Utilize a SMART-on-FHIR client libraries -- [Javascript](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/) or [Python](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-py/) in your chosen programming language. These libraries simplify the process of working with SMART-on-FHIR specifications. Explore real-world [use cases and examples](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/server-quick-start/#) of SMART-on-FHIR applications. Understanding how SMART-on-FHIR is applied in practical scenarios can guide your development.

6. Testing Environment:
Access a [testing environment](https://smarthealthit.org/developer-resources/) with sample patient data. Platforms like the [SMART Health IT Sandbox](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/) provide a simulated environment for testing SMART-on-FHIR applications.

7. Community Support:
Join forums, communities, or discussion groups related to [SMART Health IT and FHIR development](https://smarthealthit.org/smart-on-fhir-community/). Engage with the community to seek guidance, share experiences, and stay updated on best practices.

### Setting up your App development

Now that you have a good understanding of FHIR API, Smart-on-fhir applications, design and implementations, you are ready to use the GOSH FHIR server for the Hackathon. We've provided [example setup](https://github.com/gosh-dre/ucl-fhir-hack) using [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/). This template shows you how to run example SMART-on-FHIR App developed for testing the Hack. However, you can use other `javascript` frameworks such as [`ReactJS`](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), [`svelte`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte), [`AngularJS`](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide), etc

If you are using [Javascript](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/), which is required for frontend development, these frameworks are required to be installed.

1. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
2. [Javascript](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/) client

However, if you prefer `Python`, these frameworks are required to be installed:

1. [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [fhirclient](https://pypi.org/project/fhirclient/) client with example setup.
3. [fhirpy](https://pypi.org/project/fhirpy/#conditional-update) for fhir data manipulation.

##
‚≠êÔ∏è **tips** Developers can use [`Vanya Client`](https://vanyalabs.com/Integrations/Azure) to view and validate created `FHIR` resources.

##
If for any reason you would want to continue developing on your own within your local FHIR server, you'd need to install the following:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. [Postgres](https://commandprompt.com/education/how-to-download-and-install-postgresql/)
3. Download the fhir data from [Synthea](https://mitre.box.com/shared/static/ydmcj2kpwzoyt6zndx4yfz163hfvyhd0.zip)
4. Load the downloaded data to the `URL`, which can be found at `http://localhost:8090/fhir` by using the [Python code](https://rajvansia.com/synthea-hapi-fhir.html) as shown.

## Running the FHIR Server locally

To run the FHIR Server locally, install the necessary frameworks as specified above, create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your preferred directory location, copy and paste [docker file](https://github.com/gosh-dre/ucl-fhir-hack/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) into a `.yml` file. Then run `docker-compose up` to start the server. This will run the server locally.

After you must have created and run the docker file, go to your browser and run `http://localhost:8090/fhir/metadata` to show you the server capabilities -- what the server can do.

**Please Note** You can use [Postman](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/use-postman) or any other API platform to access your server for testing purposes.

##
### Building mobile-based FHIR Application.

We are yet to register the GOSH FHIR API with Apple for iOS / Android App developers. Hence, the Hackathon will not support development of smart-on-fhir App for mobile application. However, based on the learnings on this Hack, students are adviced to develope apps using [`swift-smart`](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/Swift-SMART/) documentation. 


##
### Sample FHIR queries:
<hr>

We want to share sample FHIR queries to help the students better understand the process during development. This query is following [FHIR resources RESTful APIs, searching and the principles](https://fhir-ru.github.io/search.html)


In this example we would be using the blood pressure readings for demonstration purposes. They are typically stored in a single Observation with two components, one for Systolic and another for Diastolic as shown below:
```
{
    "resourceType": "Observation",
    "id": "9fff022b-7f8c-468c-b9bc-fa913a5d83a3",
    "meta": {
        "versionId": "1",
        "lastUpdated": "2024-01-28T12:47:07.338+00:00"
    },
    "status": "final",
    "category": [
        {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category",
                    "code": "vital-signs",
                    "display": "vital-signs"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "code": {
        "coding": [
            {
                "system": "http://loinc.org",
                "code": "55284-4",
                "display": "Blood Pressure"
            }
        ],
        "text": "Blood Pressure"
    },
    "effectiveDateTime": "2016-05-08T13:00:00+01:00",
    "issued": "2016-05-08T13:00:00+01:00",
    "component": [
        {
            "code": {
                "coding": [
                    {
                        "system": "http://loinc.org",
                        "code": "8462-4",
                        "display": "Diastolic Blood Pressure"
                    }
                ],
                "text": "Diastolic Blood Pressure"
            },
            "valueQuantity": {
                "value": 89,
                "unit": "mm[Hg]",
                "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
                "code": "mm[Hg]"
            }
        },
        {
            "code": {
                "coding": [
                    {
                        "system": "http://loinc.org",
                        "code": "8480-6",
                        "display": "Systolic Blood Pressure"
                    }
                ],
                "text": "Systolic Blood Pressure"
            },
            "valueQuantity": {
                "value": 135,
                "unit": "mm[Hg]",
                "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
                "code": "mm[Hg]"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
<hr>

1. So this is the example FHIR query;

```
GET https://gosh-synth-fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/Observation?code=55284-4&component-code-value-quantity=8462-4$gt20&_count=5
```
-  **Pay attention to this query**. Here we are asking the API for Observations with a Loinc Code of 55284-4 ‚Äî ‚ÄúBlood Pressure.‚Äù
Also, we‚Äôre insisting that the component list contains both a ‚ÄúDiastolic Blood Pressure‚Äù value AND a quantity value over 20. 

- Finally, we paged it with `_count=5` (asking the API to return the first 5 pages). 

- What made this query possible is the `composite search parameter`, `$`. However, the essence of the paging with `_count=5` is to avoid errors such as 
```{
    "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
    "id": "dc808062714e7f5da5451bb1428da898",
    "meta": {
        "lastUpdated": "2024-02-07T10:11:15.7622307+00:00"
    },
    "issue": [
        {
            "severity": "error",
            "code": "invalid",
            "diagnostics": "Sub-queries in a chained expression cannot return more than 1000 results, please use a more selective criteria."
        }
    ]
}
```

When you see errors like this especially when you are implementing `chained expressions`, please, try to check your query and implement pagination.

**Please Note:** Other examples of `chained expressions` are `...patient.birthdate=ge2011-01-01&patient.birthdate=lt2011-04-01...` 

2. The second query is a typical query we used in the [example setup](https://github.com/gosh-dre/ucl-fhir-hack)

```GET https://gosh-synth-fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/Condition?onset-date=2012&code=65363002&_summary=count``` 

Here, we are asking the FHIR API for ` Otitis media` conditions recorded in 2012. Meanwhile, this is how it looks like in code 
```https://gosh-synth-fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/Condition?onset-date=${selectedYear.value}&code=${selectedDisease.value}&_summary=count```

3. The third query, asks the API to return `Patients` born between `1st January, 2000` and `1st January, 2006`. 

You can also flip this to mean `return Patients between the ages of 0 to 5 years`

```https://gosh-synth-fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/Patient?birthdate=ge2000-01-01&birthdate=lt2006-01-01&_summary=count```

Again, let's break down this query:

- `https://api-fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/Patient` is the base URL for querying patient resources in the Azure API for FHIR.

- This `birthdate=ge2000-01-01` parameter specifies that the birthdate of the patients returned should be greater than or equal to `January 1, 2000`. This filters out patients born on or after `January 1, 2000`.

- This `birthdate=lt2006-01-01` parameter specifies that the birthdate of the patients returned should be less than `January 1, 2006`. This filters out patients born before `January 1, 2006`.

- `_summary=count` ensures the API returns the count, `how many of these Patients` fall within this category. If you change `_summary=data`, it returns the actual dataset.

**Take note of the usage of `&`**

So, combining these two parameters, the query effectively retrieves patients whose birthdates fall between `January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2006`, which corresponds to patients aged 0 to 5 years.
